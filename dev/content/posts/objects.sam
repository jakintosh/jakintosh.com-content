section: Introduction

	This is the first chapter in a series that outlines a philosophical framework called {Cooperative Coalescence}(em). As our first step, we will define what we mean by {Philosophy}(b) in the first place, and why it is important. We will then dedicate the bulk of the chapter to deriving a {Metaphysics}(b); this means that we will explore the fundamental question of "What Exists?". Finally, we will spend a little time with one of the components of the metaphysics, called the {Concept}(b).
	
	This might sound extremely academic and dense, but I do my best to walk through these ideas in small, reasonable steps, using grounded thought experiments. I encourage you to dive in and see how it goes. Even if it {does}(em) prove to be too dense, I encourage you to move on to the next chapter anyway and see if you ever end up making it back here.
	
	The point of being this thorough is to provide the details for those who come looking for it; I imagine that most people may end up being drawn in by some of the higher level chapters later on, and I want this lower level philosophy to be here if and when they come looking for the foundations of those ideas.

section: Philosophy in 60 Seconds

	x-subsection: The What and Why

		So, {Cooperative Coalescence}(em) is a philosophical system. But what actually is philosophy, and why is it important?
		
		Philosophy is the study of "fundamental questions". There are many branches of philosophy, with some of the most important being: {Epistemology}(b), the study of knowledge; {Logic}(b), the study of reason; and {Metaphysics}(b), the study of {reality}(em). To lay the groundwork for {Cooperative Coalescence}(em), we will start with a metaphysical lens in the next section.
		
		section:(class="new-concept") Metaphysics
			x-field: Philosophy
			x-definition:
				Metaphysics is the study of the fundamental questions of existence, matter, reality, and consciousness. Metaphysics is concerned with answering the question {"What are the things that exist?"}(em) as well as categorizing those "things".

		What makes philosophy so important is that it is the foundation for every other branch of human thinking. Philosophy sits underneath Politics, Religion, and Ethics. The true power of a well designed philosophyical system is that it can provide a strong and stable base for human society. In other words, philosophy is how we can "scientifically" create a consistent and well reasoned worldview.

		The most important takeaway is this: since philosophy sits underneath everything else, then the way a society answers the fundamental questions of philosophy dictates {everything}(em) about how that society is structured. {Every aspect of your life is shaped by the socially dominant philosophical framework.}(strong) You should understand what that framework is, and how to judge its quality.

	x-subsection: The Importance of Axioms

		At the base of any argument is an {Axiom}(b): an idea that can't be reduced any further, and that we have to {assume to be true}(em). We can think of axioms as "assumptions". Assumptions in general are dangerous, and we should try to have as few of them as possible, and keep them as simple and as reasonable as we can.
		
		section:(class="new-concept") Axiom
			x-field: Logic
			x-definition:
				An axiom is a non-reducible idea that we take to be a truth; it is a foundation of an argument. Axioms should be simple and reasonable, and there should be no more than the absolute minimum needed to make our argument.

		Poorly designed arguments have very "unstable" axioms that leave a lot of room for error.
		
		Here's an example of a poor axiom: within the dominant philosophical framework {Competitive Individualism}(em), there is an axiom, an {assumption}(em), that human beings have elevated importance over other living and non-living things. But why? There are various different explanations for it, but most of them boil down to "because it {feels}(em) true". (We will dig much deeper into this example in a later chapter.)
		
		This is a lazy and dangerous way to craft the foundational arguments of human society. If it's true, then let's prove it! And if it's not true, then we ought to figure out what that means for us. {We can't be afraid of seeking out potentially scary truths.}(strong)

		{Cooperative Coalescence}(em) is an attempt to build a new philosophy on top of axioms that are simple, reasonable, and integrated with the most up-to-date scientific knowledge. Instead of trying to make high level arguments that must be unquestionable, we will instead craft a solid metaphysical base and build our framework from there. This work can be a little challenging, but if we don't do it this way, we'd effectively just be making things up.

section: The Metaphysics of Coalescence

	Let us begin by defining our {Metaphysics}(b). As we said before, {metaphysics}(em) is concerned with answering the question of {"What exists?"}(strong)
	
	So, uh, {what exists?}(em)

	aside: This is most likely going to be the densest and most abstract component of the entire philosophical framework. It's only natural: we're exploring the most foundational philosophical question, and since it will form the base for everything else we want our answer to be well reasoned. A tip before diving in: if you ever feel lost, feel free to move on and come back later. Because of how interconnected many of the pieces of this framework are, you might get more out of this section after you've read the chapters on Systems, Emergence, and Cognition. While this is the "foundation" of the system, there's no right or wrong order to read it in. In fact, even if you do get through it all now, I encourage you to come back and occasionaly read it again as you progress through the framework.
	
	x-subsection: Abstract and Concrete Objects

		Most traditional metaphysics have two base categories of objects that exist: the {Concrete}(b) objects and the {Abstract}(b) objects. The concrete objects are physical objects, while the abstract objects are "ideas" or "concepts". We can agree that a physical desk "exists", and that the concept of the number three also "exists", and that the nature of these two objects is different, yes?

		section:(class="status-quo") Abstract and Concrete Objects
			x-field: Ontology
			x-field: Metaphysics
			x-definition:
				Concrete objects are "things" made out of matter, while abstract objects are "things" that are not made out of matter. Ideas, concepts, information, and knowledge all exist in the realm of the abstract.

		This is a pretty good starting point. However, I don't think this differentiation is specific enough, and I think we should push further. Over the last century, we have drastically expanded the boundaries of atomic and sub-atomic scientific knowledge. We have a much more vivid understanding of the "essence of matter" now than we used to, and we should use that knowledge to inform our definitions.
	
	x-subsection: Matter Exists

		So we ask: {Knowing that everything is made up of sub-atomic particles that interact with other sub-atomic particles, how do we draw the line between one physical object and another? Is there a meaningful scientific way to differentiate between the atomic interactions of the air around a desk and the desk itself? And what separates a droplet of water from the ocean once it falls in?}(em)

		If we answer this question truthfully without relying on our current assumptions about the world, we'd say: {There is no physical basis for separation between concrete objects.}(strong)

		To explain: from a physics perspective, an atom in the surface of the desk can (and does) interact with any of the atoms nearby, not {only}(em) the ones it has strongly bonded to. And similarly with the water: the molecular bonds in a droplet are no different than those in the ocean. The particles that make up the universe just {exist}(em), interacting with any and all other particles that comes their way. The particles themselves have no concept of "desk" or "water droplet".
		
		However, we can clearly see that "desk" and "water droplet" can be identified as separate objects, we'll need to find {something else}(em) to explain the separation of matter into different objects within our metaphysics.

	x-subsection: Matter Has Possibility

		In order to find that {something else}(em), we must derive it from the facts that we have. Since we can observe, study, and explain the behavior of matter, we'll take the fact that {Matter Exists}(b) as an axiom (an assumption) at the root of our argument.
		
		From that starting point, what can we discover? Immediately, we can derive one concept from that axiom alone: if matter exists, then it must also have at least one "property"—the property of existence. Therefore, if matter exists, then matter has properties. In our universe, matter has other properties too, such as an electrical charge, mass, and size.

		section:(class="proof")
			x-given:
				x-axiom: Matter Exists
			x-arrow-connector:
			x-then:
				x-concept: Matter has Properties

		Now with these two ideas, can we derive anything else? Let's think it through with a thought experiment about the simplest possible universe.

		section:(class="thought-experiment") The Simplest Universe
			x-related-concept: Matter has Possibility

			Picture in your mind a brand new empty universe, completely separate from our own. Inside this universe there is only a {single point}(b). It's not an atom composed of smaller pieces; it is just a singular point.
			
			"The Point" is not moving, it is not vibrating, it is not rotating. It has no size, no weight, no mass. It doesn't even have a {position}(em), since there is nothing else to measure a position against. The only property of "The Point" is that it exists.

			Now, what are the possibilities in this "Simplest Universe"? "The Point" has no width, length, or height, and so there are no physical dimensions in this universe. There is no movement, no relationships to other objects, no possibility for change. The Point can't do anything, can't go anywhere, can't even disappear—the possibility of "nothing" doesn't even exist in this universe. Math, chemistry, biology—none of these things can exist in this universe, because there is no {possibility}(em) for them.

			There is just the one eternal possibility of "The Point Exists".
		
		Through this thought experiment about "The Simplest Universe", we can start to see an important concept: {the possibilities for matter emerge from the properties of that matter.}(strong)
		
		section:(class="proof")
			x-given:
				x-axiom: Matter Exists
				x-and:
				x-concept: Matter has Properties
			x-arrow-connector:
			x-then:
				section:(class="new-concept") Matter has Possibility
					x-field: Metaphysics
					x-definition:
						The existence and properties of matter determine what is possible for that matter. For example, if matter has no orientation, then it is not {possible}(em) for it to rotate. If matter has no position, it is not {possible}(em) for it to move.
						
						Since all matter that exists has at least one property—the property of existence—then all matter has at least one possibility—that it exists.
		
		We can call the total possibilities of matter its {Possibility Space}(b).

		In "The Simplest Universe", there is only one particle of matter, and it has only one property: that it exists. This results in a very small possibility space with a single possibility: "the existence of the point".
		
		In {our}(em) universe, there are many more particles—popular estimates say at least 3x10{80}(sup)—and those particles have more properties, giving our universe a possibility space so massive that calculating it would be nearly impossible (nevermind actually comprehending the result of the calculation).

		So, getting back to our question: is "possibility" our {something else}(em) that allows us to explain the separation of matter into distinct objects? We'll soon see that the answer is "Yes", but let's continue exploring this idea to see why.

	x-subsection: Possibility and Outcomes

		We've now constructed several concepts from our single, reasonable axiom that {Matter Exists}(b). We know that if matter exists then matter has properties, and if matter has properties then matter has possibility. So in our quest to answer the question {What exists?}(strong), we now have two answers: {Matter}(b) exists and {Possibility}(b) exists.
		
		The study of matter is covered exhaustively by the field of {Physics}(b), but what can we say about possibility?

		To start: possibility is not {probability}(em), nor is it {plausibility}(em). In other words, just because something {can}(em) happen, does not mean that it {will}(em) happen. This means that the number of possibilities in the universe is most likely far, far larger than the things that actually occur.
		
		To understand this better, let's walk through a thought experiment around something we're all a lot more familiar with: a screen.
		
		section:(class="thought-experiment") The Possibilities of a Screen
			x-related-concept: Outcomes Emerge from Possibility

			Think about the screen you are reading this on: every single pixel on the screen is capable of displaying 16.7 million colors, and the most common display size is 1920 pixels wide by 1080 pixels tall for a total of 2,073,600 pixels. That means that the number of possible images the screen can display is 16,777,216{2,073,600}(sup), or 1.5x10{14,981,179}(sup).
			
			That is a number that is almost {15 million digits long}(em).
			
			If you remember from earlier, we said that the number of particles in the universe is most likely around 3x10{80}(sup), which is already unfathomably large. The possibility space of this screen is {so absolutely unfathomably larger}(em) than the number of particles in the universe.

			That being said, it's important to note how many of the images within the screen's possibility space are "nonsense". Imagine if every pixel on the screen displayed a random color: it would just be static noise. And yet that's what the vast majority of the images look like within the possibility space of the screen. That means that the trillions of images anyone has ever seen (and ever will see) on a screen are among the very very few that could ever have meaning to a human being. This is what we mean by "possibility is not probability".

			This leads us to think about those "very very few" images that end up making it out of the possibility space, and onto an actual screen. Every word document, every website, every social media post, every frame of every video that anyone has ever watched and ever will watch; everything anyone has ever seen on a screen at all, first existed in the screen's possibility space. 
			
			In other words: {From a theoretical perspective, every image that can possibly be displayed on a screen already exists within the possibility space of the screen}(strong).

		x-arrow-connector:

		section:(class="new-concept") Outcomes Emerge from Possibility
			x-definition:
				Every single real {Outcome}(b) emerges from its associated {Possibility Space}(b).
				
				In the simple example of a screen, every image (outcome) that has ever been displayed on a screen was already present within that screen's possibility space.
				
				In the case of physical matter, every single "thing" (outcome) in the universe emerges from the possibility space created by all of the particles of matter and their properties.

		We now have one more building block: the existence of matter creates possibility, and {from possibility emerges real outcomes.}(strong) Those "outcomes"

	x-subsection: Possibilities are Conceptual

		The final—and most important—thing we notice is that since possibilities are not physical, they are {conceptual}(em). In fact, the possibility space of matter makes room for more than just "possible material outcomes", {but also for things that are purely conceptual.}(strong)
		
		To illustrate what I mean: in "The Simplest Universe", due to the properties of "The Point", there was no possibility for position or movement, and so there was no {concept}(em) of position or movement. There was only a single unchanging thing, so there was no {concept}(em) of numbers or count, and as a result no concept of mathematics. Since nothing could change, there was not even a {concept}(em) of time.
		
		In our universe, the particle properties of electric charge and mass create the {concept}(em) of Physics. The multitude of particles create {concepts}(em) of relationship and number, and from those the concept of mathematics. The properties of matter also create the possibility for particles to come together to create atoms, and for those atoms to bond into molecules. This new layer of possibility creates the {concepts}(em) of Cosmology, Geology, and eventually Biology.

		Given these examples, we should expand our understanding: {inside the possibilty space of matter is every concept in the universe.}(strong) These concepts can represent possible configurations of matter (outcomes), but can also be purely conceptual "ideas".

		This also finally solves our "separation" problem. While the particles are just interacting with other particles, we can now say that what separates the desk from the air around it, and the drop from the ocean, are the {concepts}(em) of "desk", "air", "droplet", and "ocean".

	x-subsection: Matter and Concepts

		So where has all this exploration landed us?
		
		We've proven that if matter exists, then matter has properties. If matter has properties, then matter has possibility. Within the possibility space of matter exists every possible concept in the universe.

		So now, let us answer our original question one more time: {What exists?}(strong)

		Given everything we've covered, we now claim: The only things that exist are the elementary particles that make up atoms, which we'll call {Matter}(b). However, from the possibility space created by the properties of Matter emerges the non-physical {Concepts}(b).

		section:(class="new-concept") Matter and Concepts
			x-field: Cooperative Coalescence
			x-field: Metaphysics
			x-definition:
				Matter and Concepts are the two base categories of "things that exist". Matter is the particles that make up the physical aspect of the universe, and non-tangible Concepts are what give structure and meaning to the universe.

		In the end, this doesn't end up being that different than the "Abstract/Concrete Object" dichotomy of traditional Ontology. However, the small differences and the reasoning behind them are important. Instead of calling a "Desk" a self contained concrete object and leaving it at that, we instead say that there exists some matter, and that the concept of a distinct "Desk Object" comes out of the possibility space of the matter itself. We no longer have to make incorrect assumptions about how physics works, since atoms don't "belong" to objects, but instead the objects {emerge}(em) from the atoms.

section: The Nature of a Concept

	How do we define a concept if a definition is made out of concepts? This is the issue with working at the "bottom" of "existence"—we're in the territory of axioms, here.
	
	So instead of directly defining "Concepts", we will instead build up axioms, {assumptions}(em), about what we expect from them. We'll do that by thinking through some questions about what they are and where they come from, and end up with a list about what we can say about the nature of concepts.
	
	x-subsection: "What" are Concepts?

		To begin, let's start with some examples.
		
		The number three is a concept. The game of Baseball is a concept. The calendar is a concept, an hour is a concept, and "next tuesday" is a concept. The freezing point of water is a concept. The concept of concepts themselves is a concept.
		
		{Numbers, rules, and information are all concepts.}(strong)
		
		The {concept}(em) of your smartphone is an concept, which is separate from the {actual atoms}(em) that make up your phone. The concept of your phone's {screen}(em) is a concept, and the concept of its {battery}(em) is a concept too. Materially, these objects are all just atoms. The concepts of "screen", "battery", and "complete smartphone" are what give those atoms meaning in context.
		
		{The ideas that separate physical matter into distinct objects are concepts.}(strong)

	x-subsection: "Where" are Concepts?

		But where do concepts come from? We're talking about something that has no physical presence, so "where" is an awkward question. However, one answer does spring to mind: the mind itself. Our brain is made out of physical matter, but the thoughts that occur in our mind are concepts.
		
		{Everything in our mind must be a concept.}(strong)
		
		Does this mean that concepts are thoughts that exist only in the mind? Well, no. Even before humans had the capacity to think, we can agree that "the concept of the number three" still existed, even if it hadn't been discovered by humans yet. And in millions of years if humanity has faded away, "the concept of the game of Baseball" would still exist, even if nobody had thought about it for eons and will never think of it again.

		{Concepts exist independently of the mind.}(strong)

	x-subsection: "How" are Concepts created?

		One final question we can ask is: how do concepts come into existence? You may have agreed with me that "the concept of the number three" still existed before being discovered by humans, but you might be more reluctant to agree that the "Happy Birthday Song" existed before humans {created}(em) it.

		Let's look at it in a different way: 

		{Concepts exist outside of time.}(strong)

		{Concepts are not created, but "discovered".}(strong)

	Is it possible to simplify this definition any further? Should we even try? I don't think it matters much. This understanding that  concepts are non-physical things that "exist" regardless of whether they are discovered, is enough. Concepts are the "matter" of ideas. We can take this as an axiom.

	section:(class="new-concept") The Nature of Concepts

		1. Abstract ideas—like numbers, rules, and information—are Concepts.
		2. Material things can be "wrapped in" and represented by a Concept.
