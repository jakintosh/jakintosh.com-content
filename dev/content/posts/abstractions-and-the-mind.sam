Should I be worrying about lenses in here too? I think abstractions are separate and small and applicable to everything. Useful for describing systems, lenses, physics, etc. Maybe lets separate them.

What is an abstraction? Abstraction is when we group things together into a single larger part. There are so many things in the world that it would be impossible to function without abstractions.

important ideas:
- abstraction is grouping multiple things into a new single thing
- creating an abstraction cause both information loss and gain
- abstractions can be layered

the reason abstractions are important is that they are what the brain is built to do. the human sensory system takes in an insane amount of raw information, and then filters out that raw information into "abstracted" version of itself; instead of raw points of light, pressure, and sound waves, it becomes images, object recognition and placement, physical orientation, the sound of someone's voice. a raw sound wave is just pure data, but through processing and abstracting, our brain picks it apart and groups it into parts like "the hum of the refridgerator" or "the sound of your mother's voice". when we think about a "single" object, that is again an act of abstraction. my phone wrapped in a case on my desk becomes a single object, even though I can take the phone out of the case, and then disassmble the phone into a pile of parts, and then break its glass into dust, and so on. we can navigate up and down through abstractions; instead of breaking down the phone on the desk, we could abstract up and see the desk as a single unit, or the office, or the whole apartment, or the city block, the city itself, etc. We can pick and choose the right "level" of the abstraction depending on the circumstance. we can get in a car and navigate the abstraction of it's control, how the wheel maps to direction, and the pedals map to speed, but at the same time we can operate at a higher level of abstraction as an element within the flow of traffic itself. we can use abstractions to break down large goals into smaller pieces: you want to lose weight, so you have to exercise more and also eat less calories, you make a plan to exercise by running 3 times a week, you are actively running by puttin on your shoes and putting one foot in front of the other.

human language is abstraction. we take all of the physical world, all of our human emotions, needs, and desires, and map it all onto a limited set of words.

so, okay, what's the point here? abstraction is when we take a bunch of "things", and wrap them up into a new single object. taking a bunch atoms and calling them a molecule, taking a bunch of buildings and calling them a neighborhood, taking a bunch of people and calling them a family. this is really helpful for simplifying large bits of information within a context.

abstractions can be good when the context provides any lost information, but abstractions can be bad when removed from their original context.

========

i don't think it's clear what an object is, or why it's important

========

okay so i went and wrote a whole thing on philosophy and concepts now. so how does this recontextualize what abstractions are? we now know that concepts

section: Prerequisites

	Before reading this chapter, you should understand the following ideas:

	1. {Concepts}(b) are the ideas, information, and relationships that make up the non-physical aspects of the universe.
	2. Concepts emerge from the properties of {Matter}(b), which are the particles that make up the physical aspects of the universe.
	3. Every concept in the universe has always existed and will always exist, since they exist within the {possibility space}(b) of matter.
	4. Physically, there's no separation between distinct objects like "Desk" and "Water Droplet"; that separation only exists conceptually.

	If these statements don't make sense to you, you can read {Matter and Concepts}(a|href="{{base_url}}/coalescence/matter-and-concepts.html") to learn about them in detail, or just accept them as a given to continue on with this chapter.

section: Introduction

	Abstractions are at the foundation of human thinking. Our ability to create and navigate abstractions is what gave humans language, society, art, and science. We all use abstractions every day, and without them we would be collapsed in a heap on the floor, unable to function. And yet... most people have never had an intentional and focused lesson on what abstractions are.
	
	{This is that intentional and focused lesson.}(strong)

	In order to talk about abstraction in a meaningful context, we'll first 

	section:(class="chapter-preview") Abstractions and The Mind

		In this chapter, we're 

		1. Define what {Philosophy}(b) is in the first place, and why it is important
		2. Derive a {Metaphysics}(b), which means we'll explore the fundamental question of {"What Exists?"}(em)
		3. Describe the {Concept}(b), one of the key components of the metaphysics we'll develop

section: The Mind

	In the first chapter, we learned that {concepts}(b) emerge from the possibilities of {matter}(b). Similarly, abstractions can be thought of as concepts that emerge from the possibilities of {other concepts}(em). This is an accurate way of describing abstraction within our metaphysics, but it's pretty detatched from the way we normally think about the world.
	
	{Let's bring things back down to earth.}(strong) Before diving into abstractions, let's first talk about how {concepts}(em) are related to {thought}(em).

	x-subsection: The Conscious Mind

		Once again, we start with a question: {"What is a thought?"}(b) or, before that, {"What is thinking?"}(b)

		I think we can agree that thinking happens somewhere in the brain. We can broadly categorize the activity of our brain into two categories: the subconscious and the conscious.
		
		The {Subconscious}(b) is our background processes: it is our sensory functions, our motor skills, the rhythm of our breath. Meanwhile, the {Conscious}(b) is our "intentional thought": it is our inner monologue, decision making, and daydreams... our "consciousness".
		
		From a biological perspective, there's no real need to separate these two components, since they both interact with and depend on each other. But from a philosophical perspective, we can draw a line around that "consciousness" and give it a new name: {The Mind}(b).
		
		section:(class="new-concept") The Mind
			x-field: Philosophy
			x-definition:
				The active, intentional thoughts we have inside our brain is our mind. The mind is generally the center of our "self"; it is the perspective we are seeing from and thinking from. It is the voice inside our head, the thing that wonders what to eat for breakfast, what pants to wear, and what career to pursue.
				
				The mind is where thinking takes place.

	x-subsection: Mechanics of The Mind
		
		Our mind is a machine that is built to process {concepts}(em). Inside our mind we have concepts that represent every "thing" that is representable; our favorite color, our understanding of history, and our mental construction of our physical environment are all concepts in our mind. (Remember: {the concept of a physical thing is separate from the physical thing itself.}(a|href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images"))

		The mind is more than just a sea of concepts: the concepts also have relationships to other concepts. These connections can look like the "pizza" and "ramen" concepts both pointing to a "food" concept, or the "Hey Jude" concept pointing to "The Beatles" concept in addition to a collection of concepts representing memories of that song being played.
		
		The relationships between objects are like "links" on a webpage. What we end up with is something that resembles the World Wide Web: a bunch of objects in our mind that have "links" to other objects, that have more links to other objects, creating an endless web of associated objects.

	x-subsection: The Nature of Thought

		And so we ask again: {What is a thought?}(b)
		
		{A thought is the process of following the "links" between objects in your mind.}(strong)
		
		aside: We see this truth reveal itself in language like "train of thought". When we "lose our train of thought", we usually regain it by trying to remember the most recent object we can, and then following the same links between objects in our mind.
		
		This form of thinking, called {Associative Thinking}(b), is the most common and is also the foundation for all types of thought.

		section:(class="new-concept") Thought
			x-field: Philosophy
			x-definition:
				A "thought" is the process of creating a string of connected objects in your mind. Thoughts can have many sizes and shapes, but the common thread between all of them is that in order to think, we must {follow links between objects}(em).

		Sometimes the intention behind a thought is to reach the final object—in this case the thought is a "search". Other times the goal is to create the complete string of objects itself–this would be a "synthesis of ideas", common when learning or creating new knowledge (which are arguably the same thing).
		
		Using these building blocks of {associative thinking}(em), we can perform more complex types of thinking like {Pattern Recognition}(b). In this form of thinking we still follow links between objects, but we are also matching the objects we encounter against certain patterns. This lets us filter or synthesize information in more complex ways.

		To help reinforce these concepts, let's look at some example thought processes.

		section:(class="thought-experiment") Thinking About Thinking
			x-related-concept: Abstract Objects
		
			Here are some cool examples :)


section: Abstractions are Concepts

	The basic principle of abstraction is very simple. In fact, we've already In the first chapter, we saw how {matter}(em) doesn't separate itself into distinct objects like a desk or book, but that the {concept}(em) of a desk can be "wrapped" around some particles to conceptually group them as "a desk".
	
	{This is the essence of abstraction: a conceptual wrapper for other matter or concepts.}(strong)
	
	section:(class="new-concept") Abstraction
		x-field: Metaphysics
		x-field: Philosophy
		x-definition:
			An abstraction is the result of wrapping one or many objects—both material and/or conceptual—inside a separate . The new object—the abstraction—becomes a simplified way to refer to a collection of things as one thing.

	We can {abstract}(em) some matter into the concept of a battery, and some other matter into the concept of a screen. However, we can further abstract those objects into the concept of a smartphone.
	
	When you look at your phone, do you see a collection of parts, or a single whole? Do you even recognize the case on your phone as a separate object from the phone itself? Do you ever think about the molecules or atoms that make up all of the components? {Abstractions}(b) are what let us treat our phone as a single object.

	
	Let's take a look at an example.

	section:(class="thought-experiment") Abstractions in Chess
		x-related-concept: Abstraction
		
		To play chess, you need 33 physical objects: a flat checkered surface, 16 black pieces, and 16 white pieces. In our mind, we create abstract concepts that represent those physical pieces: a chess board, pawns, knights, rooks, etc. We can then take those abstractions and place them all inside {another}(em) abstraction that represents "a complete chess set".
		
		We also have abstract objects in our mind that represent the rules of chess, like the objective of the game and how pieces are allowed to move. We create a "pawn" by attaching the rule object for a pawn with the small black wooden piece object. The resulting abstraction is now a new entity within the context of the game, with the ability to move around the chess board and take enemy pieces.
		
		{Remember, this abstraction of a "pawn" lives only in our (and our opponent's) mind—the little piece of wood doesn't actually have restrictions on it's physical movement.}(em)
		
		We build layers of abstraction in our mind about what the pieces are, if they are friendly or enemy, how they are allowed to move, what is our current strategy, and so on. {Even the entire context of the game is an abstraction}(em), and if someone outside the game were to walk up to us and ask us a question while playing, we could mentally move ourselves outside the abstraction of the chess game, answer the question, and return to it.
	
	Aside from just chess, we use abstractions for {everything}(em), whether we're conscious of it or not. Language is a great example; {words}(em) are abstractions for the objects they refer to (again, "the word is not the thing"). We use abstractions to separate our work from our play, to organize all of our knowledge, and to keep track of all the different guys named "Mike" that we know.

	x-subsection: Examples

		Phone as a concrete -> abstract -> abstraction layer thing

section: Layers of Cognition


	The most powerful property of abstractions is that we can layer them—in other words, that we can abstract an abstraction.
	
	Our entire perception of reality is built out of layered abstractions. In order to "see", raw light hitting our retinas is abstracted into images, those images are abstracted into distinct objects, and those objects are abstracted into the concept of a desk, or a bike. We're not actually seeing a "bike"—we're processing a bunch of {light that bounced off the bike}(em) and hit our retinas. But through the power of those layered abstractions, we can interpret that raw light as "a bike".
	
	The ability to layer these abstractions helps us maintain a manageable {cognitive load}(em) in our brain. Without this ability to simplify those millions of dots of light into a single "bike" concept, we would max out our cognitive load and be incapable of functioning.

	section:(class="new-concept") Cognitive Load
		x-field: Cognitive Psychology
		x-definition:
			When the brain is processing information, it only has so much {working memory}(em) (short-term memory) that it can use to hold into information. Using more working memory increases the cognitive load. When we run out of working memory, our cognitive load hits a ceiling, and our ability to process information sharply declines. This is "Cognitive Overload".

	Layering abstractions is helpful in reducing cognitive load, but another important trick of the human brain is that we can {shift between those layers}(em). We can zoom in and out of different abstractions when necessary, and in most cases we do this automatically.
	
	Like in our chess game: we can have a deep abstraction built around the state of the game, our current long term strategy, and the moves we are considering, but we can step out of the abstraction of our game to answer an unrelated question, or maybe to get up and get a glass of water.

	section:(class="thought-experiment") Abstracted Driving
		x-related-concept: Abstraction
		x-related-concept: Abstraction Traversal
		
		Driving a car is a great example of how we semi-consciously shift between abstractions.

		When we first start learning how to drive (or ride a bike), we tend to be mostly focused on the "operation of the controls". We learn where controls are and how the machine responds to our input, and build up an intuition of what behavior is safe.

		After a while, driving (or riding a bike!) becomes automatic. We can shift into a higher level of abstraction, where we don't think about how much to turn the steering wheel or where to move our foot, but we see ourselves as "one with the car", only thinking about "speed up", or "change lanes".
		
		With even more experience and on long drives on open highways, even those "one with the car" behaviors abstract away: we are operating at the level of "the flow of traffic" itself, not actively thinking about what we're doing at all. We can shift our abstraction layer to operating music or navigation controls, or to play a game counting the number of yellow cars you pass.

		However, when the tail lights are lit up in front of us, we can shift back down to "one with the car", again thinking to slow down. In certain circumstances we can even drop down to the "operation of controls" layer, if we suddenly find ourselves skidding on ice unsure of what to do.

	x-arrow-connector:

	section:(class="new-concept") Abstraction Traversal
		x-field: Cognitive Psychology
		x-definition:
			The brain can "zoom in" and "zoom out" of abstractions, allowing us to move to the most suitable level of detail for the task at hand.

section: Information and Context

	However, there's an easily missed side effect to creating all of these layers of abstraction. When we reduce "more information" into "less information", we are going to (obviously) end up {losing}(em) some information. Luckily, with well made abstractions, we can preserve that information through a "context".

	For an example, let's get back to all of those "Mikes" we know.
	
	section:(class="thought-experiment") Names in Context
		x-related-concept: Abstraction

		We know "Michael Jordan" from work, and we also know "Michael Bay" who lives in our neighborhood.
		
		Within the context of our workplace, we abstract "Michael Jordan" down to "Mike". We and our coworkers have an implicit understanding of who we're referring to when we just say "Mike". In this case, even though we lose information by abstracting his full name to a nickname, {the context preserves the lost information.}(strong)
		
		However, there's also risk with that abstraction. If we take that abstraction outside of it's context and use "Mike" while talking to our mom, she won't know who we're talking about unless we've explicitly established a context of who "Mike" is in our conversation.
		
		Even worse is if we used the shortened "Mike" (referring to Mr Jordan) in a conversation with our neighbor. In that case there's a direct conflict between contexts, and the neighbor may interpret "Mike" as "Michael Bay" down the street. {This is the danger of removing an abstraction from its context.}(strong)

section: What We Learned

	Abstractions are a pretty cool guy, and doesn't afraid of anything.

	section:(class="recap") Objects and Abstractions

		h3: {Key Concepts}(strong)
		1. {Concrete Objects}(b) are physical things made out of matter
		2. {Abstract Objects}(b) are ideas that can represent physical and non-physical things
		3. All objects in the mind are abstract
		4. {Abstraction}(b) is when we create a new abstract object that encapsulates other objects
