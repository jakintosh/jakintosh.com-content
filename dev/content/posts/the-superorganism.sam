section: The Plan

	This article contains a lot of big ideas, even though it's not particularly long. So before we get into it, I think we should first talk about what we're about to cover.

	x-subsection: Start at the Beginning

		In this article, we'll be reasoning about a core building block of a philosophical system called {Cooperative Coalescence}(em). This building block is about the nature of life and how a human being fits into "everything else". Because we're dealing with something so foundational, it may seem too abstract to be worth talking about. However, it's important to "start at the beginning"; {I believe that most of the problems we face today stem from the fact that so many things have not been thought through from their foundations.}(strong) Once we have built a strong foundation, we can then get to the more interesting work of applying the system to analyzing the world, though we don't get that far in this post.

	x-subsection: The Main Point

		The two existential questions that we will be exploring in this article are:

		1. What does it mean to be alive?
		2. Are humans special among living things?

		The answer to these two questions shape every aspect of human society, and yet for many of us, our answers tend to be quite shallow. By spending the time up front to come up with thoughtful answers, we'll be making the rest of our job much easier.

	x-subsection: Mentally Preparing

		To start this article we will take a look at the "status quo", looking at how our mainstream philosophy ({Competitive Individualism}(em)) answers these questions. We will then take a look at a handful of concepts that might be new to us, and then finally use those concepts to rebuild a new foundation that answers our questions differently.

		The concepts introduced in this article may be difficult to buy into right away, because in some ways they diverge from some very deeply rooted assumptions we all have about the world. My hope is that by building these ideas up all the way from the most basic questions, you will have an easier time adjusting to this system and taking it for test drives in your daily life.

		That's enough prep, let's dive in.

section: The Status Quo

	x-subsection: Foundational Concepts

		There are a lot of different things that people believe about how the world works. Most of the time, people get stuck arguing about those beliefs without realizing that nearly all ideas are built on top of other ideas, and that some ideas are more foundational than others. In modern society, the realm of politics is generally where we discuss some of the most foundational beliefs we all hold, on topics like work ethic, patriotism, education, or immigration. However, these political battleground topics are not philosophical foundations; they are built on even more layers that get deeper into existential questions.

	x-subsection: Religious Foundations

		In {Competitive Individualism}(em) (the dominant philosophical framework), one of the most foundational stories is that living things are separated from non-living things, and that human beings are the most advanced living organism, uniquely having the gift of thought, rational decision making, and perhaps even the spark of a soul.

		In order for this idea to hold weight, it needs to stand on something more concrete and unquestionable. Historically, the backing for this idea comes from religious traditions, in which humanity was created in the image of God(s), being given special abilities to mark our special status as God's children.

		section:(class="status-quo") Human Divinity
			x-field: Religion
			x-field: Theology
			x-definition:

				Human beings were created by God(s). Humans were created in the image of the divine, and given special capability and status in the world based on their relationship to the creator(s). Humans are separate and special from other living creatures.

		From the present day it's easy to see how this idea developed, and it's core flaw in reasoning: it was created by starting with its premise ("we must be special") and then working backwards to justify that somehow. Early humans were sentient animals that developed advanced cognition and stumbled upon the same questions we're asking here, so over time they developed stories and traditions (religions) that answered their existential questions.

	x-subsection: Scientific Foundations

		In the modern day, scientific inquiry has given us new information about the mechanics of the universe, which has started to dismantle the old religious traditions' influence.

		That brings us to our modern scientific understanding of humanity's role in the universe. At some point early on in our biology education, we learn about the hierarchy of life.

		section:(class="status-quo") Hierarchy of Life
			x-field: Philosophy
			x-field: Biology
			x-definition:

				Organisms—like human beings—are at the top of a hierarchy. Organisms are made up of organs (like the brain, heart, and lungs for humans), and those organs are made up of tissues. Tissues are composed of cells, and cells are composed of organelles like the mitochondria and nucleus. Organelles are built out of molecules, molecules are built out of atoms, and atoms have components like electrons, protons, and neutrons.

				The organisms at the top of the hierarchy are the individual plants and animals that exist and make changes in the world.

		However, our scientific knowledge didn't develop all at once: new concepts emerge in small bits and pieces based off of the constantly growing body of past research. As science advanced, each new scientific understanding was made within the context of those religious foundations. So in practice, each small scientific discovery could slowly be absorbed into and reframed by the dominant worldview ("Human Divinity"). This isn't a flaw in the science itself, but in our interpretation of those facts.

		Once again, this means our conclusion was reached backwards, just like the religious foundations. We started with the current assumption ("Humans are Divine and Special") and worked backwards to fit scientific concepts to match that story. If we were to rebuild our entire foundation from scratch with everything we know now, we might end up with a different story...

	x-subsection: Human Exceptionalism

		We've now looked at two different existential foundations, though both produce the same answer to the question {"Are humans special among living things?".}(strong) Whether through divinity bestowed by God or by being at the top of a biological hierarchy, both interpretations answer with humans being in a position of prominence and dominance within the natural world.

				section:(class="status-quo") Human Exceptionalism
					x-field: Competitive Individualism
					x-definition:

						Human beings are unique and separate from the rest of the natural world, whether through their religious connection to a deity, position at the for scientific reasoning.

		Human exceptionalism is the foundation that western society (and {Competitive Individualism}(em)) is built on. It's important to realize that, regardless of if you buy into this idea by itself, it informs many of our institutions, laws, and cultural norms. It's impossible to engage in modern society without interacting with this principle on a daily basis. We'll spend the rest of the article revisiting some key scientific concepts from the last hundred years that will help us assess this foundation, and ultimately build a new one.

section: New Lenses

	With our status quo defined and our intentions set, our next step is to acquire some new {lenses}(em). I'll dig more deeply into lenses later in a dedicated post, but for now, in short: {lenses are ideas we can use to better understand the world.}(strong) Just like we look through the lens of a telescope to see into the distance, or the lens of a microscope to see small things, or the lens of a camera to frame visual compositions, these "idea" lenses help change our perspective to see "more" of the truth.

	x-subsection: Emergent Behavior

		Before we challenge this status quo, lets walk through a thought experiment that introduces us to the systems theory concept called {emergent behavior}(em).

		section:(class="thought-experiment") Visualizing Emergent Behavior

			x-related-concept: Emergent Behavior

			Picture in your mind a bin filled with one hundred smooth metal balls, each the size of a tennis ball or a baseball. Now imagine dropping them onto the floor, one at a time, in the same spot. What happens? They bounce off of each other and slide around the floor; some stay nearby, and others roll for quite some distance. In the end, all of the balls are on the floor, spread out over a large area.
			
			Next, repeat that same mental experiment with metal cubes of the same size. What happens this time? The cubes don’t roll, though they may bounce around a little bit. After dropping a dozen or so cubes, they may start stacking on top of each other, because the tops of the earlier cubes form a flat surface for new cubes to sit on. In the end, you’ll have a small pile of cubes, perhaps a few cubes high, and all of the cubes will be very close to the starting point.
			
			Finally, repeat the mental experiment one more time, but with metal balls that have of dozens of long sharp spikes sticking out of them. The result? Most likely an even taller pile of objects, as the spikes dig into the ground and create a strong stable base, and the spikes of each newly dropped ball get latched into the spikes of the existing pile of balls. They spread even less and stack even higher than the cubes.
			
			In each example, we perform the same process (dropping 100 objects in the same spot) but end up with very different outcomes, where the only difference was the shape of an inanimate metal object. The smooth balls created a “thin, slippery” environment, because now there was a layer of rolling balls in a single layer on top of the ground, spread out over a large area. The cubes created a stable, contained structure with a small amount of height. The spikes created a focused and somewhat tall mound that is “sticky”, since other objects moving past or blowing in the wind could easily get stuck in the spikes.
			
			The different way these shapes interacted with each other to create new properties is an example of {emergent behavior}(em). Each of the objects are made out of the same material, are roughly the same size, and were brought together in exactly the same way, yet they created very different structures. This property of {emergence}(em) can be observed in many systems.

		x-arrow-connector:

		section:(class="new-concept") Emergent Behavior
			x-field: Cybernetics
			x-field: Systems Theory
			x-definition:
				Emergence occurs when a system gains a new property or behavior that didn't exist in any of its parts. These emergent properties or behaviors exist due to the structure of the system itself. In this way, we can say that emergence comes from the {relationships between parts}(em), not the parts themselves.

	x-subsection: Emergence and Hierarchy

		Let's bring this back

		Getting back to our understanding of the structures of life as a hierarchy: I believe that our perspective is not quite right. While this structure of life can look like a hierarchy from a certain angle, hierarchy is not the {correct}(em) way to describe it. In hierarchy, the key factor is cascading control or ownership from the top-down: a boss giving instructions to subordinates, or a family tree where parents create a new generation of children.

		If we try to fit this pattern to the structures of life, we can make it work at a surface level: an organism has organs, which have tissues, and so on. But the organism doesn’t “own” or “control” its organs… in fact, it’s the complete opposite: the systems of organs interacting with each other {create}(em) the organism. This is a complete inversion of hierarchy. Instead of lower levels being created from or controlled by the higher levels, {the lower levels create the higher levels through emergent behavior}(em).

section: Paradigm Shift: The Emergence of Life

	x-subsection: The Story of Life: A History of Emergence

		Our metal object metaphor was intentionally chosen to make the first emergence, atoms to molecules, easier to visualize. Atoms are the simple elements that make up all matter in the universe, and there are only a little over 100 known elements. Depending on the physical properties of each atom, they attract to each other and combine to form different molecules that have different properties and shapes, the same way our metal objects created different structures based on their only their shape. Moving from the level of atoms to the level of molecules creates a massive change in what is possible: there are only 118 known elements, but because of the many different ways you can combine them, there are tens of millions of known molecules (and theoretically an infinite amount more to be discovered). So, given a bucket of atoms, the bonds they create and molecules they form will {emerge}(em) from the properties of the atoms in the bucket; no amount of wishful thinking will cause a bucket of lead atoms to create water (2 hydrogen atoms, and 1 oxygen atom).

		So molecules emerge from atoms, which give us new, more advanced behaviors that the atoms don’t have by themselves. From there, we start to see the possibility of small “elemental machines”, like our “slippery” spheres, “strong” cubes, or “sticky” spikes. These very simple molecular machines then interact in a similar way, creating more complex (but still relatively simple) systems of little machines. Some of these little systems may be self perpetuating, meaning that the behaviors that emerge from them end up creating an environment that supports its continued existence. These molecular machines do well, and we might start to call some of them “organelles”. Eventually, a long string-like molecule that has an emergent property of repelling water wraps itself into a circle, trapping some of those organelles inside. In fact, the environment that enables this to happen once actually lets it happen millions and millions of times; the behavior of a membrane emerged, and with it, the concept of a cell.

		With a cell membrane that provides protection from surrounding elements, new behaviors are capable of emerging from the new environment within the cell, as the organelles can develop more specialized behaviors. Eventually, a nucleus emerges, and the cell is capable of reproducing itself. With cells able to multiply into potentially large numbers, coordination can emerge, and we see multicellular structures begin to take shape. From here we can simplify and connect the rest of the dots with the theory of evolution, bringing us to the present day.

	x-subsection: Holarchy

		Okay, so these structures are {not}(em) hierarchical, but they {are}(em) emergent. Where does that leave us? Well, we have a structure where, at each level, emergence produces a new {whole}(em). An atom is a distinct thing, just like a molecule is a distinct thing, like a cell, and so on. Each level is emergent from {and composed of}(em) the previous level, like a Russian nesting doll. The name for this type of structure is {holarchy}(em) (pronounced “whole-ark-ee”). A holarchy is a connection between {holons}(em), and a holon is something that is both a part and a whole. In a holarchy, each element is not only itself a complete thing, but also a building block for another complete thing. Through this lens, we can say that “life” is just the name we give to the emergent complexity of the holarchy of physical matter.

		section:(class="new-concept") Holarchy
			x-field: Philosophy
			x-field: Cybernetics
			x-definition:

				A {Holon}(em) is an entity that is both a part and a whole, and a {Holarchy}(em) is a system of connected holons.

section: A New Lens: The Emergent Self

	We’ve now built up a new understanding of what it means for something to be alive, which is a pretty radical idea. However, for most people at this point it might still seem a little abstract. Lets make it personal.

	From our perspective as a human being, we feel uniquely “separate” from something like a cell, or even other organisms. We can think and feel, we have a mind, we have a {soul}(em). This belief that we are special is what leads many of us to subconsciously adopt the top-down perspective where organisms (and specifically humans) are at the top of a hierarchy. But our new “emergent holarchy” paradigm shows us that life is just the behavior that emerges from complexity, so what does that mean for {human}(em) life? The easiest way to answer this is to analyze the source confusion: our brains.

	The human brain is capable of something we call thought. It gives us our mind, full of ideas and memories that create our sense of self. But mechanically, the brain is a collection of smaller components: our nervous system carries raw information from the world through our body and into the brain, where neurons process that information with chemicals and electricity. For example, light enters our retinas and hits photoreceptor cells on the back of our eyes that generate electricity when exposed to that light. Those pulses of electricity get fed into an extremely dense network of neurons, which are wired to process that light into visual information. Those neural networks are like jumbles of wires and switches organized so that when a certain input is recognized, we contract muscles to move or breathe, or access stored data from our memories to make a decision, or visualize some concept inside our mind’s eye.

	This is the most difficult connection that needs to be made: just like the behaviors of molecules emerge from the complex connections between simple atoms, human consciousness emerges from the complex connections between the neurons in our brain. Our consciousness and sense of self are an {emergent property}(em) of the complex system of the human brain and body. Our “ability to think” and “sense of self” do not come top-down from the will of a soul, but bottom-up by emerging from a complex web of sensory nerves and trillions of neural connections. The experience we have of consciousness is just what emerges from a massive amount of sensory data that is stored and processed in a highly networked way. The “self” is emergent.

section: Paradigm Shift: Beyond the Organism

	We can now understand “life” to be the behaviors that emerge from ever more complex organizations of matter. This concept, distilled to “the holarchy of life”, gives us a pattern that explains each transition of complexity, from atomic bonds to human consciousness. This has one very profound implication: if we continue following this pattern {beyond}(em) the organism, then there may be even higher levels to the holarchy of life. If a bunch of cells that are sitting next to each other performing tasks in some kind of organized way is what we understand as a tissue, then what is a bunch of organisms existing together and performing tasks in an organized way?

	{This is the Superorganism.}(strong)

	x-subsection: Human Superorganisms

		In the human realm, these superorganisms would be our institutions: our families, our schools, our governments, companies, and churches. Each of these structures is composed of multiple organisms that come together and receive certain stimuli that then create specific coordinated behavior. Superorganisms are capable of much more than the individual organisms they are composed of, as evidenced by the power of a single worker vs an entire factory, or a single soldier vs an army. These institutions have rules and boundaries (both written out explicitly through rules or laws, or carried out implicitly through social norms) that give them a certain “shape” that guides their behavior.

	x-subsection: “Seeing” the Superorganism

		Because the superorganism exists at a higher level than we do, it can be very difficult to reason about. For example, how would a cell interact with or understand an organism? At each level of the holarchy, the entire world exists entirely at that level: from the cell’s vantage point, an organism would just be “a bunch of cells”; to an atom, there. By using abstractions like that one, we can practice “seeing” the superorganism.

		Picture yourself in the role of a muscle fiber cell. You are surrounded by many other muscle fibers, wrapped up in a bundle. You are all receiving little electrical impulses that signal a contraction, and when you contract together you’re collectively capable of moving the bones you are attached to. In this example the muscle cell isn’t aware that it is “part of” muscular tissue, it is just one of many fibers working together—it is capable of responding to instructions and working with others. In this way, we can see that the muscle tissue isn’t a separate object the way that we perceive it from a higher level, but that “muscle tissue” is more of a conceptual entity that exists only as the sum of its parts (muscle fiber cells). Digging deeper, those muscle fiber cells are composed of organelles, composed of molecules, composed of atoms. From an individual atom’s perspective, there are only other atoms that it is either attracted to or not. Each layer of the holarchy exists in a world of its own.

		We can learn from this mental exercise to reason about where we stand as humans in the holarchy of life. We see ourselves and the other organisms in the world as individual entities. However, we can also understand how this is the same perspective that every other level in the holarchy has: a world of atoms (to an atom), or a world of cells (to a cell). It’s natural that we see “a world of organisms”, but we also know that those other levels perspectives are not complete; there are higher levels of abstraction. I’m being overly redundant here because this is one of the most fundamental concepts of this entire philosophy: {within the framework of “life as emergent behavior”, the structures that emerge from collections of organisms—the superorganisms—are just as alive is the organisms they are composed of.}(strong) This can be an extremely difficult concept to actually internalize, because it is so abstract. I’m not saying that superorganisms are “like” a living thing, I’m saying that with the definition of life we’ve developed, they {are}(em) a living thing.

	x-subsection: Systems of Superorganisms

		So if we’ve already moved past the organism and determined that there is the larger superorganism, does that mean we can keep going? Yes, we can. Many superorganisms can come together to create even larger complex systems, like the many plant, animal, and fungus species that make up the ecosystem of a forest, or the neighborhoods, companies, governments, and infrastructure that make up a human city. As with every previous layer, we keep seeing more complex emergent behaviors at each layer. A human being has complex behavior, but groups of humans create even more complex social dynamics, and an entire city of human organizations interacting with nature and the built environment create very complex social, political, and economic behaviors.

		Finally, at the very highest abstraction layer is the entire planet: every organism, superorganism, and ecosystem interconnected in an incredibly complex global dynamic system. Just like the individual cells that make up the many subsystems of our bodies, we as individual human beings are just a single small entity that make up the subsystems of the global ecology.
