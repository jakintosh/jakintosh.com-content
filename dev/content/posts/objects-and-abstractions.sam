Should I be worrying about lenses in here too? I think abstractions are separate and small and applicable to everything. Useful for describing systems, lenses, physics, etc. Maybe lets separate them.

What is an abstraction? Abstraction is when we group things together into a single larger part. There are so many things in the world that it would be impossible to function without abstractions.

important ideas:
- abstraction is grouping multiple things into a new single thing
- creating an abstraction cause both information loss and gain
- abstractions can be layered

the reason abstractions are important is that they are what the brain is built to do. the human sensory system takes in an insane amount of raw information, and then filters out that raw information into "abstracted" version of itself; instead of raw points of light, pressure, and sound waves, it becomes images, object recognition and placement, physical orientation, the sound of someone's voice. a raw sound wave is just pure data, but through processing and abstracting, our brain picks it apart and groups it into parts like "the hum of the refridgerator" or "the sound of your mother's voice". when we think about a "single" object, that is again an act of abstraction. my phone wrapped in a case on my desk becomes a single object, even though I can take the phone out of the case, and then disassmble the phone into a pile of parts, and then break its glass into dust, and so on. we can navigate up and down through abstractions; instead of breaking down the phone on the desk, we could abstract up and see the desk as a single unit, or the office, or the whole apartment, or the city block, the city itself, etc. We can pick and choose the right "level" of the abstraction depending on the circumstance. we can get in a car and navigate the abstraction of it's control, how the wheel maps to direction, and the pedals map to speed, but at the same time we can operate at a higher level of abstraction as an element within the flow of traffic itself. we can use abstractions to break down large goals into smaller pieces: you want to lose weight, so you have to exercise more and also eat less calories, you make a plan to exercise by running 3 times a week, you are actively running by puttin on your shoes and putting one foot in front of the other.

human language is abstraction. we take all of the physical world, all of our human emotions, needs, and desires, and map it all onto a limited set of words.

so, okay, what's the point here? abstraction is when we take a bunch of "things", and wrap them up into a new single object. taking a bunch atoms and calling them a molecule, taking a bunch of buildings and calling them a neighborhood, taking a bunch of people and calling them a family. this is really helpful for simplifying large bits of information within a context.

abstractions can be good when the context provides any lost information, but abstractions can be bad when removed from their original context.

section: Introduction

	Abstractions are one of the foundations of human thinking, and one of our most powerful logic tools. Our ability to create and navigate abstractions is what gave humans language, society, art, and science. All of us use abstractions every day, and without them we would be collapsed in a heap on the floor, unable to function. And yet... most people have never had an intentional and focused lesson on what abstractions are.
	
	{This is that intentional and focused lesson.}(strong)

	This article is the first in a series about a philosophical framework called {Cooperative Coalescence}(em), which is a new cultural operating system for humans living in a complex world. As I was writing the longer and more essential articles, I found that I was repeatedly re-explaining this concept of {abstraction}(em) in many different places.
	
	The majority of the foundational components of {Cooperative Coalescence}(em) are new "thinking tools", but I realized that the concept of abstraction was perhaps the most fundamental of them all. So before we walk through this entire philosophical framework, let's first start with a quick primer on one of the core components of philosophy itself: the nature of thought, "objects", and abstractions.


section: Objects in the Mind

	And so you ask: {"What are abstractions, and why are they so important?"}(em)

	Abstractions are a special kind of "idea". Beyond that, the best way to explain what abstractions are is to first explain what "ideas" are, and what "thinking" is. Once we define objects and the mind, the concept of abstraction will be almost self explanatory.
	
	x-subsection: Abstract Objects

		{"Okay, so what are 'ideas'?"}(em)
		
		"Ideas" are conceptual things: they are the things that don't physically exist. "Ideas" are not made out of atoms, and they are not something we can touch. An "idea" can exist inside our mind, but also outside of our mind: for example, the concept of {the number three}(em) still exists even if we're not thinking about it. We can even communicate an "idea" to another person without transferring any physical matter. The traditional philosophical term for what we've been describing as an "idea" is an {Abstract Object}(b).

		section:(class="new-concept") Abstract Object
			x-field: Ontology
			x-field: Philosophy
			x-definition:
				Abstract objects are the non-physical things of the universe. They are the inverse of things that are physical and made out of matter, called {Concrete Objects}(b).
				
				Information, knowledge, concepts, and mathematics are all made up of abstract objects. A person's name, the game of Basketball, the freezing point of water, and the mental representation of "your smartphone" are all abstract objects, while a human body, a basketball, an ice cube, and your smartphone itself are all concrete objects.
		
		While concrete objects make up the entirety of the physical universe, {abstract objects are what create meaning and structure in the universe.}(strong) It should become more apparent {why}(em) this is the case as we go, so let's move on for now.

	x-subsection: The Conscious Mind

		{"And what is 'thinking'?"}(em)

		I think we can agree that thinking happens inside the brain. We can broadly categorize the activity of our brain into two categories: the subconscious and the conscious. The {Subconscious}(b) is our background processes: it is our sensory functions, our motor skills, the rhythm of our breath. The {Conscious}(b) is our "intentional thought": it is our inner monologue, decision making, and daydreams... our "consciousness".
		
		From a biological perspective, there's no real need to separate these two components, since they both interact with and depend on each other. But from a philosophical perspective, we can draw a line around that "consciousness" and give it a new name: {The Mind}(b).
		
		section:(class="new-concept") The Mind
			x-field: Philosophy
			x-definition:
				The active, intentional thoughts we have inside our brain is our mind. The mind is generally the center of our "self"; it is the perspective we are seeing from and thinking from. It is the voice inside our head, the thing that wonders what to eat for breakfast, what pants to wear, and what career to pursue.
				
				The mind is where thinking takes place.
		
		Our mind is a machine that is built to process abstract objects. Inside our mind, we create abstract objects that represent every {thing}(em) that is representable. We use these abstract objects as mental boxes that can represent physcial {things}(em) or non-physcial {concepts}(em).
		
		Every "thing" in our mind is an abstract object (which we will now simply refer to as an "object"). Even when an object represents a physical thing—like a desk—the {idea}(em) of the desk in your mind is still abstract. {The idea of a physical thing is separate from the physical thing itself.}(strong)(a|href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images")

		Now, the mind is more than just a sea of objects floating through the void: these objects also have relationships to other objects. These connections can look like the "pizza" and "ramen" objects both pointing to a "food" object, or a specific song's object pointing to its arist's object in addition to a collection of objects representing memories where that song was played.
		
		These relationships between objects are like "links" on a webpage. What we end up with is something that resembles the World Wide Web: a bunch of objects in our mind that have "links" to other objects, that have more links to other objects, creating an endless web of associated objects.

	x-subsection: The Nature of Thought

		And so we ask again: what is a thought? {A thought is the process of following the "links" between objects in your mind.}(strong)
		
		aside: We see this truth reveal itself in language like "train of thought". When we "lose our train of thought", we usually regain it by trying to remember the most recent object we can, and then following the same links between objects in our mind.
		
		This form of thinking, called {Associative Thinking}(b), is the most common and is also the foundation for all types of thought.

		section:(class="new-concept") Thought
			x-field: Philosophy
			x-definition:
				A "thought" is the process of creating a string of connected objects in your mind. Thoughts can have many sizes and shapes, but the common thread between all of them is that in order to think, we must {follow links between objects}(em).

		Sometimes the intention behind a thought is to reach the final object—in this case the thought is a "search". Other times the goal is to create the complete string of objects itself–this would be a "synthesis of ideas", common when learning or creating new knowledge (which are arguably the same thing).
		
		Using these building blocks of {associative thinking}(em), we can perform more complex types of thinking like {Pattern Recognition}(b). In this form of thinking we still follow links between objects, but we are also matching the objects we encounter against certain patterns. This lets us filter or synthesize information in more complex ways.

		To help reinforce these concepts, let's look at some example thought processes.

		section:(class="thought-experiment") Thinking About Thinking
			x-related-concept: Abstract Objects
		
			Here are some cool examples :)


section: Abstraction

	We've already seen our first example of abstraction, which is when we wrap a concrete object in an abstract object in order to "use" that object in our thoughts. {This is the essence of abstraction: creating a new abstract object that is a conceptual container for other objects.}(strong)

	However, in addition to putting concrete objects in these containers, we can put abstract objects in there as well. And since we've already determined that every object in our mind is abstract... you can see the power here.

	Let's take a look at an example.

	section:(class="thought-experiment") Abstractions in Chess
		x-related-concept: Abstraction
		
		To play chess, you need 33 physical objects: a flat checkered surface, 16 black pieces, and 16 white pieces. In our mind, we create abstract concepts that represent those physical pieces: a chess board, pawns, knights, rooks, etc. We can then take those abstractions and place them all inside {another}(em) abstraction that represents "a complete chess set".
		
		We also have abstract objects in our mind that represent the rules of chess, like the objective of the game and how pieces are allowed to move. We create a "pawn" by attaching the rule object for a pawn with the small black wooden piece object. The resulting abstraction is now a new entity within the context of the game, with the ability to move around the chess board and take enemy pieces.
		
		{Remember, this abstraction of a "pawn" lives only in our (and our opponent's) mind—the little piece of wood doesn't actually have restrictions on it's physical movement.}(em)
		
		We build layers of abstraction in our mind about what the pieces are, if they are friendly or enemy, how they are allowed to move, what is our current strategy, and so on. {Even the entire context of the game is an abstraction}(em), and if someone outside the game were to walk up to us and ask us a question while playing, we could mentally move ourselves outside the abstraction of the chess game, answer the question, and return to it.

	section:(class="new-concept") Abstraction
		x-field: Metaphysics
		x-field: Philosophy
		x-definition:
			An abstraction is the result of wrapping a set of objects inside a new abstract object. The new object—the abstraction—becomes a simplified way to refer to a collection of things as one thing.

	Aside from just chess, we use abstractions for {everything}(em), whether we're conscious of it or not. Language is a great example; {words}(em) are abstractions for the objects they refer to (again, "the word is not the thing"). We use abstractions to separate our work from our play, to organize all of our knowledge, and to keep track of all the different guys named "Mike" that we know.

		Phone as a concrete -> abstract -> abstraction layer thing

section: What We Learned

	Abstractions are a pretty cool guy, and doesn't afraid of anything.
