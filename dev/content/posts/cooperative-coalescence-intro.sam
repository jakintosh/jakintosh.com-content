section:

	{Cooperative Coalescence}(em) is a new cultural operating system for humans. Its purpose is to help humans more easily navigate complexity, and to create a stronger intuition of what it means to be an individual that is part of a larger social organism.

	The core arguement of {Cooperative Coalescence}(em) is that {the foundational existential truths that the current dominant culture is built on are incomplete,}(strong) and since they are foundational they are very difficult to question. The difference between these ideas we believe to be true and the {actual truth}(em) leads to cognitive dissonance in the individual, and an inability for the larger society to effectively make the changes it chooses for itself.

	x-subsection: the old truths

		The foundational truths that I challenge are:

		1. The (human) organism is the highest and final organization in the hierarchy of life
		2. Change is created through a series of causes and effects
		3. There is a single, shared, objective reality that we all occupy together

		These three truths together provide the basis for a worldview in which: (1) an individual human can morally make decisions for only themselves; (2) using a short term cost/benefit analysis based on cause and effect; (3) within a single shared reality of limited resources. This worldview is at the core of the current primary operating system, which is {Competitive Individualism}(em).

	x-subsection: the new truths

		The updated truths that underlie {Cooperative Coalescence}(em) are:
		
		1. The organism is both a whole being and a part of larger structures in the holarchy of life
		2. Change is created by the feedback loops of countless different complex systems that are highly interconnected, and circularly dependent
		3. Human "reality" is subjective and perceived differently by each person

		These expanded truths paint the picture of a different worldview, where (1) individuals are naturally part of a larger whole, (2) the interplay between many complex systems guide decision making and understanding, and (3) each person experiences a different version of the world. This is the foundation of {Cooperative Coalescence}(em): "cooperative" meaning "working together", and "coalescence" meaning "coming together". Working together to come together. Combining all of our individual insights and understandings to get closer to "the truth", instead of fighting over which single perspective is correct.

	x-subsection: moving forward

		Much like the concepts it is designed to deal with, the components of the {Cooperative Coalescence}(em) operating system are highly interconnected and difficult to untangle. None of the components are new ideas, and the only thing I believe I can contribute is my perspective on how all of these pieces fit together. Instead of slowly teasing apart these pieces in private, I'll be doing so in public here on this site as separate posts.

		The first few topics that I know are important are {"The Superorganism",}(strong) {"Systems Thinking",}(strong) and {"Cognitive Psychology".}(strong) Each topic breaks down one of the three false truths that {Competitive Individualism}(em) relies on, and then reconstructs it. These are the three topics that I'll start with, and as I go I'll build out the framework of connections that shape the operating system itself. The goal is to explore in depth all of the components, connect the pieces, and improve everything with feedback from others. In the end there will be a clear and concise package of self contained and easy to read material (a {manifesto}(em)) for anyone to pick up and understand what {Cooperative Coalescence}(em) is about.
